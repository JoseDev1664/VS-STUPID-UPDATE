this is were you can first all the character's chromatic scales here, without having to look for them!

read the .txt files to find the location of the full soundfont for the characters!

remember: some soundfonts are full chromatic scales, or insterments

insterments : .txt file + .ogg file 

chromatic scales : .mp3 files (possibly pre-sliced)

dwp : .dwp file
